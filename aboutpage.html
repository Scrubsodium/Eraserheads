    <h1>Legacy of Eraserheads</h1>
<img src="./images/ultra.jpg" class="img1">
<p> Eraserheads was a Filipino rock band that was formed in 1989.
    The band consists of vocalist Ely <br> Buendia (middle picture upper row),
    bassist Buddy Zabala (left picture upper row), lead guitarist <br> Marcus Adoro
    (upper right picture), and drummer Raimund Marasigan (lower left picture).
    Kris <br> Dancel (lower right picture) became part of the band during the reunion.
    They were formed in UP <br> Diliman. The name "Eraserheads" was inspired
    from a film by David Lynch. They played mostly <br>covers, doing gigs in schools,
    and playing at Manila's rock club circuit, achieving little success.
    <br> <br> The band found out that they are not good at doing covers, they
    decided to write their own songs.<br> They recorded a nine-song demo in
    Raimund's garage at his provincial home (in Quezon) on year <br>
    1991 of January. In 1992, BMG records signed up the band for a three-year
    record deal.
</p>

<h1> Mainstream Success </h1>
<p> In July 1993, they started recording their debut album named
    <i> "Ultraelectromagneticpop!" (picture <br> shown in right)  </i> which featured <i>"Pare Ko</i>
    , <i>"Toyang"</i>, and <i>"Tindahan Ni Aling Nena"</i> which was also<br> 
    featured in their previous demo <i>"Pop-U!"</i> Later that year
    BMG released 5,000 copies of the album.<br> By the end of  the year,
    the album turned sextuple platinum.
</p>

<p>
    In October 1994, Eraserheads released a follow-up album entitled <i> Circus. </i>
    They said that the album <br> aptly described their life since their debut.
    The album was unpredictable and unconventional compared <br> to the OPM ballads
    at that time, and established the band members as songwriters and musicians. <br>
    The songs varied in style and mood, ranging from euphoric and hilarious to
    tender and somber.
</p>

<p>
    The group's third studio album <i>Cutterpillow </i>, was launched an open-air concert attended by fans
    <br> and followers. ith Christmas barely a month over, Eraserheads opened 1996 by making history <br> in the
    Philippine music scene once more. <i> Cutterpillow</i> turned gold, even before it hit the record <br> stores,
    as a result of the pre-selling promo campaign. Soon, the band shot the music video for the <br> song <i>"Ang
    Huling El Bimbo"</i> (The Last El Bimbo) from the album. Later that year, the band came <br> up with a conceptual
    Christmas album <i>Fruitcake</i>. The album is notable in that it is the first and only <br> album of the band recorded
    entirely in English. This was shortly followed by a release of a companion <br> storybook of the same title
